      <h2>GAME RULES</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":</li>
        <li>If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
        <li>If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.</li>
        <li>If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
